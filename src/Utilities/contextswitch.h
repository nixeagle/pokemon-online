  This file is for co-routines. Check on wikipedia what that is.

  Coroutines are like threads, but without concurrent access.

  A function / object that is supposed to run in a new coroutine (as with threads)
  will be given a reference to this ContextSwitcher below. Let's call that reference
  self. The function will be executed normally, until the function calls self.yield().
  When it does so, the context switcher will swap back to the main context. Then
  whatever manager/scheduler will decide to continue the function, and so the execution
  of the function will continue until it calls yield() again. Basically it's the same as a
  thread which would call sem.acquire(), and stay blocked until the main thread calls sem.release().

  The reason for having this on PO is to prevent having a high number of threads, because the battles
  used to be each in a new thread and then on the Beta Server where over 80 battles would be running
  it would cause serious problems.

  This was developped specifically for PO so it's not as generic as you would like. And if not used with
  threads it could fail badly, if you want info / examples drop on #po on irc.freenode.net, or better, on
  our forums.

  If you would like a concrete example of coroutines to understand how it works, create a main.cpp with that:

#include <iostream>

extern "C" {
#include "coro.h"
}

using namespace std;

coro_context a, b, init;

void foo(void *)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        cout << i * 2 << endl;
        coro_transfer(&a, &b);
    }

    // Returning to main
    coro_transfer(&a, &init);
}

void foo2(void *)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        cout << (i * 2)+1 << endl;
        coro_transfer(&b, &a);
    }

    //Never reached but safety mesure
    coro_transfer(&b, &init);
}

int main()
{
    coro_create(&init, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0);

    void *stack1 = malloc(256*256);
    void *stack2 = malloc(256*256);
    coro_create(&a, foo, NULL, stack1, 256*256);
    coro_create(&b, foo2, NULL, stack2, 256*256);
    coro_transfer(&init, &a);

    free(stack1);
    free(stack2);

    cout << "Hello world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}

  And figure out why it displays all numbers in order =p

  (Dont forget to include coro.c and coro.h in your project)
